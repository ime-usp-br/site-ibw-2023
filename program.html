                                using examples and data from Brazil. I will discuss the role of the effective

                            <p><strong>Title: </strong>Heuristic techniques applied to problems in Optimal Control</p>
                            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>This presentation gives an overview of  heuristic optimization
                                techniques,  such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs),  used to determine optimal control
                                strategies. These heuristic techniques can solve very complex nonlinear optimization
                                problems, which present computational difficulties or even cannot be handled by any
                                analytic
                                approaches. The advantage of metaheuristics over the classical optimization methods,
                                such as
                                Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP), is the ease of adding constraints on the system
                                and
                                also the ability to work with different controls. These methods  and some  applications
                                will
                                be presented in this lecture.</p>

                                propagation with a system of delay differential equations</p>
                            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
                                The HIV/AIDS epidemic is still active worldwide with no existing definitive cure. Based
                                on
                                the WHO recommendations stated in 2014, a treatment, called Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis
                                (PrEP),
                                has been used in the world, and more particularly in France since 2016, to prevent HIV
                                infections. In this work, we propose a new compartmental epidemiological model with a
                                limited protection time offered by this new treatment. We describe the PrEP compartment
                                with
                                an age-structure hyperbolic equation and introduce a differential equation on the
                                parameter
                                that governs the PrEP starting process. This leads us to a nonlinear system with
                                discrete
                                delay. After a local stability analysis, we prove the global behavior of the system.
                                Finally, we illustrate the solutions with numerical simulations based on the data of the
                                French Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) population. We show that the choice of a logistic
                                time dynamics combined with our Hill-function-like model leads to a perfect data fit.
                                These
                                results enable us to forecast the evolution of the HIV epidemics in France if the
                                populations keep using PrEP. This work was done in collaboration with members of the

                                IoT-to-Edge-to-Cloud environments</p>
                            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>The explosive growth and increasing power of IoT devices, along
                                with the rise of advanced communication options (e.g., 5G), have resulted in
                                unprecedented
                                volumes of data. To manage and process this massive amount of data, such tasks are often
                                delegated to centralized computing facilities (i.e., Cloud platforms). Albeit providing
                                an
                                abundance of resources, the centralized nature of the cloud can induce a significant
                                topological distance between the computing resources hosted on the Cloud and the vast
                                majority of IoT devices due to their geographical location. Thus, one of the biggest
                                challenges that the Cloud is facing is to address the increasing demands for new

                                terms of Quality of Service (QoS), such as computational speed and faster response
                                times. To
                                deal with this drawback, multi-layered architectures are emerging, where computing
                                resources
                                and applications are distributed from the edge of the network to the cloud, realizing
                                the
                                IoT-to-Edge-to-Cloud computing continuum. In this architecture, the fact that the Edge
                                computing nodes are topologically in proximity to end devices is a key enabler of
                                advanced
                                services/applications that were not feasible before while relying solely on the Cloud.
                                Data
                                can be processed at the Edge and then offloaded to the Cloud, when required, for further
                                processing. Yet, deploying applications using the continuum's distributed infrastructure
                                is
                                very challenging due to the geo-distribution of the infrastructure (i.e., networking
                                issues), the heterogeneity of underlying hardware/technologies, and the lack of
                                efficient
                                abstractions for handling and orchestrating diverse workloads. This presentation will

                            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
                                How to apply partial or total containment measures during a given finite time interval,
                                in
                                order to minimize the final size of an epidemic — that is the cumulative number of cases
                                infected during its whole course? We provide here a complete answer to this question for
                                the
                                SIR epidemic model. Existence and uniqueness of an optimal strategy is proved for the
                                infinite-horizon problem corresponding to control on an interval $[0,T]$, $T>0$ (Problem
                                1),
                                and then on any interval of length $T$ (Problem 2). For both problems, the best policy
                                consists in applying the maximal allowed social distancing effort until the end of the
                                interval $[0,T]$ (Problem 1), or during a whole interval of length $T$ (Problem 2),
                                starting
                                at a date that is not systematically the closest date, and which may be computed by a
                                simple
                                algorithm. These optimal interventions have to begin before the proportion of
                                susceptible
                                individuals crosses the herd immunity level, and lead to limiting values smaller than
                                this
                                threshold. We also study the following more general issue (Problem 3): how to apply
                                confinement during a (possibly disconnected) set of measure at most $T$, in order to
                                minimize the final size? This problem is shown to have the same optimal solution than
                                Problem 2. These results have been obtained with Michel Duprez (Inria), Yannick Privat
                                (Université de Strasbourg), Alain Rapaport (INRAE) and Nicolas Vauchelet (Université

                                In these works, we explore several ways to combine Symbolic and Non-symbolic AI. We are
                                convinced, as several other colleagues in AI community, that reuniting these two
                                branches of
                                IA would lead to impressive, more robust, more reliable, and more sustainable, AI
                                models. I
                                will present some recent works we have done on Kownledge-Driven Active Learning, where
                                the
                                criterion to select which new unlabeled sample should be annotated directly derives from
                                prior external knowledge on the data and First-Order-Logic formulation. I will also
                                present
                                our on-going work on "Learning to Explain and Explaining to Learn" where we look for
                                concepts learned by the neural network and for designing new hierarchical losses taking
                                into
                                account any priori knowledge. I will finally present our recently published work on

                                Model Embedding, and explain why the results are important and what could be the next
                                step.

                            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
                                To realize the full potential of data science, models (in particular, ML models) must be
                                built, combined and ensembled, which can be very complex as there can be many models to
                                select from. Furthermore, they should be shared and reused, in particular, in different
                                execution environments such as HPC or Spark clusters. To address this problem, we
                                propose
                                Gypscie, a new framework that supports the entire ML lifecycle and enables model reuse
                                and
                                import from other frameworks. The approach behind Gypscie is to combine several rich
                                capabilities for model and data management, and model execution, which are typically
                                provided by different tools, in a unique framework.

                                The inter-host modelling of communicable diseases is a very active research area that have gained 
                                wide visibility during COVID-19 pandemics. The dynamical models are as much complex as the relevant 
                                ingredients introduced in order to catch the features associated with the research question. Even 
                                more the validation of a constructed model is related to to its capacity of describing real epidemic 
                                and endemic data as well as of designing different scenarios to investigate hypothetical situations, 
                                such as vaccination strategies [1].                                
                                In this talk I will present some inter-host models that we have developed for directly transmitted 
                                diseases [2] and vector-borne transmitted diseases [3] linked to real data of epidemics in Brazilian 
                                urban centers. I also explore some heterogeneous scenarios, for instance, of co-circulating viruses,

                                industry, 3 for health and 1 for smart cities, named IARA. Just as economic and social advances allow 
                                people to live longer and better, they also raise awareness that these advances need to happen faster 
                                and to be more sustainable and inclusive. This generates a growing demand for a better quality of life, 
                                both in urban and rural regions. One of the main paths for this increase is through the incorporation of 
                                new technologies, which allow, for example, the transformation of cities into smart cities. IARA, Artificial
